# 3-Hour Challenge: Warehouse Inventory Management Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

## Overview

Create a backend server that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to manage warehouse inventory. The server should provide a robust API to create, update, track, and query inventory data, suitable for use with VS Code or the Anthropic desktop client. Incorporate automated testing and GitHub Actions for CI.

## Features to Implement

- **Inventory CRUD:**  
  - Endpoints to create, read, update, and delete inventory items.
  - Each item should track: SKU, name, description, quantity, location, supplier, and last updated timestamp.

- **Stock Movements:**  
  - Support for recording stock in/out events (receiving, shipping, adjustments) with timestamps and reasons.

- **Inventory Queries:**  
  - Ability to search/filter inventory (by SKU, name, location, etc.).
  - Provide low-stock and out-of-stock reports.

- **MCP Compliance:**  
  - Expose the server as a Model Context Protocol service so it can be discovered and queried by compatible clients.
  - Document any required MCP endpoints and message formats.

## Engineering Requirements

- **Server Technologies:**  
  - Use a mainstream language (Python, TypeScript, Go, etc.).
  - Store data in a lightweight open source database (e.g., SQLite).

- **Testing:**  
  - Unit tests for core business logic and MCP interface.
  - Integration tests for full API flows.

- **Automation:**  
  - GitHub Actions workflow for CI:
    - Dependency install.
    - Lint and run all tests.
    - (Optional) Build artifacts or Docker image.

- **Documentation:**  
  - README detailing setup, MCP usage, and test instructions.

## Example: Interacting with the MCP Inventory Server via Copilot Chat in VS Code

When connected to the MCP server from within VS Code, you might interact with your warehouse inventory by chatting with Copilot Chat. Here are some example interactions:

### 1. Browsing Inventory

- **User:**  
  "Show me all inventory items in the warehouse."
- **Copilot Chat:**  
  Returns a table or list of inventory items, displaying SKU, name, location, and current quantity for each.

### 2. Viewing or Editing an Item

- **User:**  
  "Show details for item SKU12345."
- **Copilot Chat:**  
  Displays the item's full details: SKU, description, quantity, location, supplier, and last updated timestamp.
- **User:**  
  "Update the quantity of SKU12345 to 80."
- **Copilot Chat:**  
  Confirms the update and shows the new quantity.

### 3. Creating a New Inventory Item

- **User:**  
  "Add a new item: SKU=ABC987, name='Widget Pro', location='Aisle 2', quantity=50, supplier='Acme Corp'."
- **Copilot Chat:**  
  Confirms the item was added and displays its details.

### 4. Recording a Stock Movement

- **User:**  
  "Record a stock out for SKU12345: 10 units shipped for customer order #4567."
- **Copilot Chat:**  
  Confirms the stock movement, updates the item's quantity, and logs the event.

### 5. Querying Low-Stock Items

- **User:**  
  "Which items are low on stock (below 10 units)?"
- **Copilot Chat:**  
  Returns a filtered list of items with quantity below the threshold.

**Note:**  
All these interactions are powered by the MCP protocol’s standardized data and command messages, abstracting away the transport. The server’s README should document the MCP endpoints, expected request/response formats, and example payloads for integration.
