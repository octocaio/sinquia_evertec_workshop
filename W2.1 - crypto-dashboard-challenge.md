# 3-Hour Challenge: Cryptocurrency Dashboard Web App

## Overview

Build a feature-rich cryptocurrency dashboard as a web application. The app should enable users to view, track, and analyze various cryptocurrencies in real time, with a focus on usability and reliability. Incorporate robust testing and CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions.

## Features to Implement

- **Cryptocurrency Market Overview:**  
  - Fetch and display current prices, 24-hour changes, and market capitalization for at least 10 of the top cryptocurrencies.
  - Data should update dynamically (polling or websockets).

- **Search & Filter:**  
  - Allow users to search for and filter cryptocurrencies by name or symbol.

- **Price History & Charts:**  
  - Display interactive historical price charts (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month) for selected cryptocurrencies.
  - Use a charting library to visualize the data.

- **User Watchlist:**  
  - Enable users to add/remove cryptocurrencies to a personal watchlist (persisted in the browser or via backend).

- **Currency Conversion:**  
  - Allow users to convert between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.

## Engineering Requirements

- **Web Technologies:**  
  - Use a modern frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, or similar).
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

- **Testing:**  
  - Implement unit tests for core components and utility functions.
  - Add integration tests for API calls and user flows.

- **Automation:**  
  - Set up a GitHub Actions workflow for CI:
    - Install dependencies.
    - Run linting and test suites.
    - Build the production bundle.

- **API Usage:**  
  - Use the CoinCap API (https://docs.coincap.io/).  
  - You must sign up for a free account to obtain an API token, which is required for all requests.

- **API Key Security:**  
  - Host and manage the CoinCap API key securely.
  - Do not hard-code the key in source code or expose it in the frontend.
  - Use environment variables, server-side proxy, or secrets management tools (e.g., GitHub Actions secrets) to protect the key.

- **Documentation:**  
  - Provide a concise README explaining setup, usage (including how to add your CoinCap API token), and how to run tests.
