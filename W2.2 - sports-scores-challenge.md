# 3-Hour Challenge: Real-Time Sports Scores Web Application

## Overview

Develop a responsive web application that lets users browse and track live sports scores for major leagues and events. The app should provide rich information, search/filter options, and real-time updates. Incorporate comprehensive testing and GitHub Actions automation.

## Features to Implement

- **Live Scores Overview:**  
  - Display live and recent scores for at least two major sports (e.g., soccer, basketball, baseball).
  - Show game details: teams, current score, time/status, and location.

- **Game Details Page:**  
  - Provide a dedicated page/modal for each game with extended stats and play-by-play (if available from the API).

- **Team & League Browser:**  
  - Allow browsing by league or team, with filters for upcoming, live, or completed games.

- **Favorites:**  
  - Users can mark favorite teams/games for quick access and notifications.

- **Auto-Refresh & Real-Time Updates:**  
  - Implement polling or websockets for live score updates without requiring page reloads.

## Engineering Requirements

- **Web Technologies:**  
  - Use a mainstream frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).
  - Responsive and accessible UI.

- **Testing:**  
  - Unit tests for components and helpers.
  - Integration tests for API data flows and user interactions.

- **Automation:**  
  - GitHub Actions workflow for CI:
    - Install dependencies.
    - Run linting and automated tests.
    - Build the application.

- **API Usage:**  
  - Leverage a public sports API (e.g., TheSportsDB, which offers basic endpoints without registration).

- **Documentation:**  
  - Include a README with setup instructions and test execution steps.
